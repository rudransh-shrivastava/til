If you want to clear the screen you have to type `clear` and then hit Enter, however you can also use `Ctrl + l` to clear the screen.

However, when you use the `clear` command, it actually *clears* the screen (You can't scroll up).

But, when you use the shortcut `Ctrl + l` it doesn't actually clear the screen completely, it just creates another line and scrolls the terminal down, which means you can scroll up!
