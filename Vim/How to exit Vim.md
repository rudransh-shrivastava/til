There is no way to exit Vim...

I'm just kidding.

You can exit vim by typing either of these commands `:x`, `:wq`, and `:q!`.

- `:q!`: Quit file but don't save.
- `:wq`: Write the file and then quit, this command will write the file even if no changes have been made.
- `:x`: This one is interesting, If changes have been made to the file, write the file and then quit. If no changes have been made to the file, just quit.
