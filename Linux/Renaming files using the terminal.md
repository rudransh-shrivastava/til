The rename command is not available on most Linux distributions by default, but there's a way to rename files using the terminal.

We can use the move `mv` command to rename files.
Let's say there's a file named  `Windows.txt` and we want to rename it to `Linux.txt`, We can do that using the following move command:

```bash
mv Windows.txt Linux.txt
```
