# Today I Learned (TIL)

This repo is a collection of short articles about the things I learn everyday.
TILs are short Markdown notes that contain a few sentences + example code, they're too short for a blog.
I stole this idea from [jwworth/til/](https://github.com/jwworth/til/), who stole that idea from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/), who shamelessly stole that idea from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
