I always thought `Num Lock` was used to *Lock* the Numpad... 

Silly me, I only got to know what it actually does after a friend said it in a group chat.

You've seen `Home` `PgUp` `<--` written on keys in the numpad? Yup, when the Numpad is *Locked* using the `Num Lock` key, we can actually use the numpad to perform those actions.

For example after pressing the `Num Lock` key press 7, that jumps your cursor to the start of the line (home)!

I can't believe I always thought that those things were *broken* for me :')
